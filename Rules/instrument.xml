This script template can be used to add trace logging commands to 
set of VB6 codes.  When this technique is used properly, you will 
be able to run side-by-side tests to compare functionality and 
use the trace logs to help you analyze behind the scenes differences.

This process will modify the VB6 code in place.

1) Make a backup of the original source so you can restore and rerun
the instrumentation as needed.

2) Copy this file and instrument.gmsl to the usr folder in your workspace.

3) Add this script as a task to a gmProj file.

4) Edit this script: add a <Load Project> command for each VBP you wish to instrument.

5) Run this script (i.e. Run the Translate operation on this script in gmStudio).

   This will produce a bundle  file bnd file containing the instrumented VB6 code files:
   
   a) Authoring a proj_gmTraceLogger.bas module in each  VBP folder
   b) Referencing the proj_gmTraceLogger.bas module from each proj.VBP
   c) Modifying every function and sub with logic to write trace messages to a log file.

   By default the trace files are written to C:\temp; you must 
   have access to the log directory to run the application. 
   You may change this by altering instrument.gmsl.    
   
   See instrument.gmsl for details of the trace logging logic and instrumentation.
   
6) Deploy the bundle; this will replace original VB6 files with instrumented VB6 files.

7) Verify the new code.
   a) Rebuild the original VB6 to make sure it is still all well formed
   b) Compare the original and instrumented VB6 files to be comfortable with the changes

8) Translate the instrumented VB6 to produce a corresponding instrumented .NET code.

   Tip: you may want to modify your application translation script by adding 
   an Author/Fix so that VB6 logs and .NET trace  logs will not clobber each 
   other, for example:
   
   <Author...>
      <Fix name="General Fixes" host="">
         <Replace name="rename trace logger file">
         <OldBlock><![CDATA[gmTraceLogger_vb6.log]]></OldBlock>
         <NewBlock><![CDATA[gmTraceLogger_net.log]]></NewBlock>
         </Replace>
      </Fix>    
   </Author>

9) Run side-by-side tests to compare functionality and use the trace logs
   to help you analyze behind the scenes differences.
