# gmStudioCfg

Using gmStudio configuration files to experiment with GitHub.

There are three types of configuration files distributed with gmStudio:

* [Metalang files](https://github.com/mjuras/gmStudioCfg/tree/master/Metalang) that direct the standard operation of the translation engine.  These files are required for operating the translator.
* [Settings files](https://github.com/mjuras/gmStudioCfg/tree/master/Settings) that direct the gmStudo IDE.  Most of these files are required for typical operation of the Studio. 
* [Rules files](https://github.com/mjuras/gmStudioCfg/tree/master/Rules) that direct custom operation of the translation engine

The Rules files are optional
